## Intro to R
###Arithmetic 
     + (Addition)
     - (Subtraction)
     * (Multiplication)  
     / (Division) 
    ^ (Exponentiation) e.g. 3^2=9, 12^12=144
    %% (Modulo)
   #只能是數值(不可以用"six"取代6)
 
Variable assignment
    
   <-
    1  x <- 42
    2  x
    [1]42

   “ ”
   e.g. “abc”: the quotation marks indicate that “abc” is a character.


```
summary(cars)
```


You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
