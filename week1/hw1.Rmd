## Intro to R


### Arithmetic 

```
* Addition + 
* Subtraction -
* Multiplication *  
* Division / 
* Exponentiation ^  (e.g. 3^2=9, 12^12=144)
* Modulo %% (e.g.12%%12=0,8%%5=3)
#只能是數值(不可以用"six"取代6)
```

### Variable assignment

```
* <-
  1  x <- 42
  2  x
  [1]42

* “ ”
  e.g. “abc”: the quotation marks indicate that “abc” is a character.
```

summary(cars)
```


You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
