```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
# Intermeiate R note

## 比大小得出邏輯值
```{r}
*提問用* == 等於   != 不等於
e.g."character" == "character" 按照字首順序比大小(愈後的字母愈大,字首相同則比字母數量)
e.g.TRUE < FALSE 
    [1] FALSE     因為TRUE coerces to 1, FALSE coerces to 0
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
